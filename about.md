## About

Hello again.
Thought I would write the typical _about_ section, as every website needs one. Have you ever noticed how a lot of these are written in third person? As if to give the idea that they're a company or something.. Anyway, I digress.

I am a web developer living and working in London - who like many - try to break boundries by doing both front and back end development. At the moment my main choice of poison is PHP, but trying to learn Python and Ruby when I can, with limited results. Another I am trying to learn is CoffeeScript with AngularJS - which I believe make a great combo.
